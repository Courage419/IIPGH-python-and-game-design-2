# Q1
# Create set with set comprehesion where the set comprehension loops through
# two sets of iterables(in nested loops) giving us this format(containing tuples): {(n, m)}
# Example: Given these two iterables range(2)/ [0,1] and range(3, 5)/[3,4] use set comprehension to create
# this results: {(3, 0), (4, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1)}

# Q2
# [5,6,7,2,4,1,2,3,8,4,5]
# Use list comprehension on the list above to return the same list of items and also use the same technique
# for set comprehension to return a set of that list.
# Compare the two results and explain to me the difference between the two types of comprehensions used
